## Setup Instructions

Before installing the dependencies, ensure you have the latest version of pip to avoid potential installation issues. You can upgrade pip using the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 3: Additional Dependencies

If your project requires additional Python packages, make sure to include them in your `requirements.txt`. For packages that require system-level installation (like certain database drivers or image processing libraries), document the necessary steps in your README or setup guide.

### Final Note

Remember, the purpose of `requirements.txt` is to list Python package dependencies. Upgrading tools like pip is part of the environment setup process and is best guided through documentation or setup scripts. Always test your application with the specified package versions to ensure compatibility and stability.
